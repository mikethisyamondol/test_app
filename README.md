# Skeleton App with GCP

This app was built as a skeleton or scaffolding for future MLOps projects where the CI/CD pipeline and build/deploy infrastructure can be carried over relatively easily as long as it's hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) specifically on Google App Engine. This microservice is built using FastAPI and currently has a roberta-base question answering model using the SQuAD2.0 dataset from Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/deepset/roberta-base-squad2) plugged in for functionality but can be swapped out with any ML model.
